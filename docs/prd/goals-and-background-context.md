# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Launch Phase 1 MVP in 6 weeks with production-ready dashboard deployed to Vercel
- Provide real-time visibility into BMAD agent activity (Analyst, PM, Architect, SM, Dev, QA)
- Detect and prevent conflicts when agents work against stale artifact versions
- Enable multi-project portfolio management from a unified dashboard
- Reduce agent coordination overhead by 30-40%
- Establish foundation for plugin ecosystem and extensibility
- Create the first turnkey orchestration dashboard for multi-agent workflows

## Background Context

JIVE Dashboard addresses critical coordination challenges faced by software development teams adopting AI agents in the BMAD METHODâ„¢ framework. Currently, teams using BMAD agents (via Claude Code) lack visibility into agent activity, cannot detect when agents work against outdated artifact versions (e.g., Dev implementing features based on v2 architecture while Architect has updated to v4), and struggle to manage multiple projects efficiently. Existing solutions fall short: multi-agent frameworks (CrewAI, LangGraph) provide no UI; observability platforms (Langfuse, AgentOps) are reactive rather than proactive; traditional PM tools (Jira, Linear) are human-centric and not agent-aware.

JIVE fills this white space by providing real-time agent visualization, proactive conflict detection, and portfolio intelligence in a turnkey dashboard. With the AI orchestration market growing from $5.8B (2024) to projected $48.7B (2034) and a 12-18 month window before major competitors build similar solutions, now is the critical moment to establish category leadership in AI agent orchestration.
