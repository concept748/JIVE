nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No sensitive data exposed. Public endpoint design appropriate. No auth vulnerabilities."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent build time (1.9s). Landing page 114 kB first load. Health endpoint <50ms response."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling. Railway restart policy configured. Health check enables deployment validation."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "TypeScript strict mode enforced. Clear structure. Version now centrally managed post-refactoring."

# Detailed findings
findings:
  strengths:
