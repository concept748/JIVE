# Project Brief: JIVE Dashboard

**Mission Control for BMAD AI Agent Teams**

---

**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Version:** 1.0
**Prepared by:** Business Analyst Mary
**Status:** Ready for PRD Development

---

## Executive Summary

**JIVE Dashboard** is a real-time visualization and orchestration platform for BMAD METHOD™ AI agents, enabling teams to manage multiple agent-driven software projects from a unified mission control interface.

**Primary Problem:** Teams using BMAD agents (Analyst, PM, Architect, Scrum Master, Developer, QA) via Claude Code lack visibility into agent activity, suffer from coordination conflicts when agents work against stale artifact versions, and cannot manage multiple projects efficiently.

**Target Market:** Software development teams (10-50 developers) using AI coding assistants and multi-agent frameworks, particularly those already using or planning to adopt the BMAD METHOD™ for agentic agile development.

**Key Value Proposition:** JIVE provides the first turnkey orchestration dashboard for multi-agent workflows, combining real-time agent visibility, conflict detection, and portfolio management - capabilities that frameworks (CrewAI, LangGraph) and observability tools (Langfuse, AgentOps) don't offer as an integrated product.

**Market Opportunity:** $5.8B AI orchestration market (2024) growing to $48.7B by 2034, with no current competitor offering a unified dashboard for agent coordination.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State & Pain Points

Software development teams adopting AI agents face critical coordination challenges:

**Pain Point 1: No Visibility Into Agent Activity**

- Teams can't see which agents (Analyst, Architect, Dev, QA) are working on which artifacts
- No real-time status updates (IDLE, RUNNING, BLOCKED)
- Developers waste time wondering "is the agent done?" or refreshing multiple files
- **Impact:** 30-40% of time lost to context switching and manual status checking

**Pain Point 2: Conflicting Artifacts from Parallel Work**

- Architect updates data model to v4
- Developer implements features based on v3 architecture
- Conflict discovered at deployment (expensive rework)
- **Impact:** 2-3x effort to fix conflicts vs. preventing them

**Pain Point 3: No Centralized Dashboard**

- Agent conversations scattered across chat windows
- Documents spread across file system (docs/prd/, docs/architecture/, docs/stories/)
- PMs scramble to gather status when stakeholders ask "how's it going?"
- **Impact:** 15-30 minutes to compile basic status report

**Pain Point 4: Difficult Agent Handoffs**

- Manual coordination: "Hey QA, this story is ready for you"
- QA agent lacks context - what changed? What to test?
- Back-and-forth clarifications create delays
- **Impact:** Idle time between handoffs, context loss, rework when issues found

**Pain Point 5: No Organizational Learning**

- Same coordination mistakes repeated across projects
- No data-driven insights: "which agent configurations work best?"
- Each project starts from scratch
- **Impact:** No continuous improvement, suboptimal performance

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Multi-Agent Frameworks (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen):**

- ❌ Framework-only - no UI or dashboard
- ❌ Require coding expertise (Python/TypeScript)
- ❌ No real-time visibility into agent activity
- ❌ No conflict detection
- **Gap:** Build agents, but don't orchestrate them

**Observability Platforms (Langfuse, AgentOps, LangSmith):**

- ❌ Reactive (post-hoc analysis), not proactive (real-time orchestration)
- ❌ No conflict detection or prevention
- ❌ Project-by-project, no portfolio intelligence
- **Gap:** Show what happened, don't prevent problems

**Traditional PM Tools (Jira, Linear, Notion):**

- ❌ Human-centric, not agent-aware
- ❌ No agent status tracking
- ❌ No artifact version management
- ❌ No conflict detection
- **Gap:** Manage human tasks, not AI agent workflows

**Enterprise Platforms (Microsoft Copilot Studio, AWS Bedrock):**

- ❌ Enterprise-only (expensive, complex)
- ❌ Generic automation, not BMAD-specialized
- ❌ No turnkey dashboard
- **Gap:** Infrastructure, not product

### Urgency & Importance

**Now is the critical moment:**

- AI coding assistant adoption accelerating (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code)
- BMAD METHOD™ gaining traction (v4.x stable, v6-alpha in development)
- Multi-agent orchestration market growing 8.4x (2024-2034)
- **12-18 month window** before Microsoft, Atlassian, or open-source competitors build similar solutions

**Market validation:**

- Your own pain points experiencing multi-agent coordination challenges
- 145+ feature ideas generated in 4.5-hour brainstorming session
- Competitive analysis confirms: **no turnkey orchestration dashboard exists**

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept

**JIVE Dashboard** = **Real-time Mission Control for BMAD AI Agent Teams**

A Next.js web application that:

1. **Watches** BMAD project folders via file system monitoring
2. **Visualizes** agent activity (Analyst, PM, Architect, SM, Dev, QA) in real-time
3. **Detects conflicts** when agents work against stale artifact versions
4. **Orchestrates** workflows across multiple projects
5. **Tracks progress** through BMAD phases (Build → Map → Analyze → Deploy)

### Key Differentiators

**1. First Turnkey Orchestration Dashboard**

- Not a framework (like LangChain) - a ready-to-use product
- Not infrastructure (like AWS Bedrock) - a complete dashboard
- Not observability-only (like Langfuse) - proactive coordination intelligence

**2. BMAD METHOD™ Native**

- Purpose-built for Build → Map → Analyze → Deploy workflow
- Understands 6 BMAD agents (Analyst, PM, Architect, SM, Dev, QA)
- Maps artifacts to phases (PRD = Build, Architecture = Map, Code = Analyze, QA = Deploy)

**3. Real-Time Conflict Detection**

- Version-aware artifacts (`bmad.version` in front-matter)
- Dependency graph (Architecture → Stories → Code)
- Alerts when Dev implements against old architecture

**4. Multi-Project Portfolio View**

- Manage multiple BMAD projects from one dashboard
- Cross-project analytics and learning (Phase 2)
- Organizational memory (patterns, optimizations)

**5. Plugin Architecture**

- Minimal core (event bus, agent registry, artifact storage)
- Extensible via plugins (visualizations, integrations, intelligence)
- Community-driven ecosystem (like VS Code extensions)

### Why This Will Succeed

**Technical Feasibility:**

- ✅ Proven technologies (Next.js, WebSocket, file watching with chokidar)
- ✅ BMAD agents already exist (via Claude Code) - JIVE visualizes them
- ✅ File-based artifacts (markdown with front-matter) - easy to parse
- ✅ 6-week MVP achievable with defined scope

**Market Fit:**

- ✅ Real user pain validated (your own multi-agent coordination challenges)
- ✅ Growing market (AI orchestration $5.8B → $48.7B)
- ✅ No direct competitors (creating new category)
- ✅ Partnership opportunities (OpenAI Agents SDK, CrewAI, LangGraph)

**Go-to-Market Advantages:**

- ✅ Clear positioning: "Mission Control for AI Agent Teams"
- ✅ Vendor-neutral (not locked to one framework)
- ✅ Plugin ecosystem creates network effects
- ✅ First-mover in orchestration dashboard category

**Defensible Moats:**

- ✅ Data network effects (portfolio intelligence improves with scale)
- ✅ Plugin marketplace (community contributions = lock-in)
- ✅ BMAD specialization (deep vertical vs. generic horizontal)
- ✅ Conflict detection complexity (6-12 months to replicate)

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

**1. Multi-Project Portfolio View**

- Portfolio dashboard showing all BMAD projects
- Project cards with: name, phase, agent count, story count, conflicts
- Click project → open detailed dashboard
- Add/remove projects
- **Rationale:** Core value prop - manage multiple projects from one interface

**2. Real-Time Agent Status Visualization**

- 6 agent cards (Analyst, PM, Architect, SM, Dev, QA)
- Agent status: IDLE, RUNNING, COMPLETED, BLOCKED
- Shows current artifact being worked on
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- **Rationale:** Solves "no visibility" pain point - see agents in action

**3. Artifact Tracking & Version Monitoring**

- List of all artifacts (PRD, architecture, stories, code, QA)
- Version numbers displayed (from `bmad.version` front-matter)
- Shows which agent created/modified artifact
- Dependency visualization (architecture → stories)
- **Rationale:** Foundation for conflict detection and coordination

**4. Conflict Detection (Basic)**

- Detect version mismatches (story references architecture v2, current is v4)
- Display conflict cards with severity (info, warning, critical)
- List affected artifacts and agents
- Manual "Mark Resolved" (automated resolution in Phase 2)
- **Rationale:** Prevents expensive rework from version conflicts

**5. BMAD Phase Progress Visualization**

- Visual representation of Build → Map → Analyze → Deploy
- Progress bars per phase (% completion)
- Current phase highlighted
- Stories moving through phases
- **Rationale:** High-level project health at a glance

**6. File System Integration**

- Watch BMAD project folders (chokidar file watcher)
- Parse markdown files with front-matter (gray-matter)
- Sync file changes to dashboard in real-time
