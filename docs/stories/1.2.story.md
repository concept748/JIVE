# Story 1.2: Health Check & Environment Validation

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** a /health API endpoint and basic landing page,
**so that** I can validate deployment and monitor application uptime.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GET /api/health returns 200 with `{ status: 'ok', version: '1.0.0', timestamp: ISO8601 }`
2. Landing page at / displays "JIVE Dashboard" and health status
3. Environment variables documented (.env.example)
4. Railway deployment successful (production URL accessible) _(Note: PRD originally said Vercel, updated per Architecture v1.1)_

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**[From Story 1.1 QA Results]**

Key learnings from Story 1.1 implementation:

1. **Next.js 15 with Turbopack:** Project uses Next.js 15, not 14 as originally planned. Turbopack enabled for fast development builds (~1.7s build time).

2. **ESLint Flat Config:** Project uses modern `eslint.config.mjs` (flat config format), NOT `.eslintrc.json`. Be aware when referencing ESLint configuration.

3. **JIVE Branding Applied:** `app/layout.tsx` already has JIVE-specific metadata (title: "JIVE - Multi-Agent Development Dashboard"). Landing page should align with this branding.

4. **Railway Deployment (Not Vercel):** Architecture specifies Railway as deployment platform. PRD originally said Vercel but this was corrected in Architecture v1.1. Story 1.1 created `railway.json` config file.

5. **Environment Variables Already Templated:** `.env.example` exists with basic variables from Story 1.1. Verify completeness for Story 1.2 (should be sufficient).

6. **TypeScript Strict Mode:** All strict TypeScript flags enabled. No `any` types allowed. This applies to Story 1.2 health endpoint and landing page code.

7. **Pre-commit Hooks Active:** Husky and lint-staged configured. Code will be auto-formatted and linted on commit.

### API Specification

**[Source: docs/architecture.md#core-endpoints (lines 676-678)]**

Health Check Endpoint:

- **Route:** `GET /api/health`
- **Purpose:** Application health status for monitoring and deployment validation
- **Response Format:**
  ```typescript
  {
    status: 'ok',
    version: '1.0.0',
    timestamp: '2025-10-15T14:30:00.000Z' // ISO8601 format
  }
  ```
- **Status Code:** 200 OK
- **No Authentication Required:** Public endpoint for health checks

### Backend Architecture

**[Source: docs/architecture.md#service-architecture (lines 1557-1570)]**

Next.js API Routes Structure:

```
app/api/
├── health/route.ts         # <- CREATE THIS FILE for Story 1.2
├── projects/
│   ├── route.ts
│   └── [id]/...
└── ws/route.ts
```

**File Location:** `app/api/health/route.ts`

**Next.js API Route Pattern (App Router):**

```typescript
// app/api/health/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json({
    status: 'ok',
    version: '1.0.0',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Use `NextResponse.json()` for JSON responses (Next.js 14/15 App Router convention)
- Export named function `GET` for HTTP GET method
- No `req` parameter needed for simple health check
- TypeScript strict mode: define interface for response type

### Frontend Architecture

**[Source: docs/architecture.md#component-organization (lines 1532-1544)]**

**App Router Structure:**

```
app/
├── (routes)/              # Route groups
│   ├── page.tsx          # <- MODIFY THIS FILE for Story 1.2 (Portfolio/Landing Page)
│   ├── project/[id]/page.tsx
│   └── settings/page.tsx
components/
├── ui/                   # shadcn/ui components
├── agent-card.tsx
├── artifact-tree.tsx
├── project-card.tsx
└── websocket-provider.tsx
```

**Landing Page File:** `app/page.tsx` (already exists from Story 1.1, needs replacement)

**Server vs Client Components:**

- **Server Components (Default):** Static content, no interactivity, data fetching during SSR
- **Client Components (`'use client'`):** Interactive, React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), event handlers

**For Story 1.2:** Landing page needs to fetch health status dynamically → Use Client Component with `'use client'` directive.

### Coding Standards

**[Source: docs/architecture.md#coding-standards (lines 2096-2117)]**

Critical rules for Story 1.2:

1. **Type Safety:** No `any` types. Define TypeScript interface for health response:

   ```typescript
   interface HealthResponse {
     status: string;
     version: string;
     timestamp: string;
   }
   ```

2. **File Naming:** Use kebab-case for all files (e.g., `health-check.tsx` if creating a component, but API route is `route.ts` per Next.js convention).

3. **Component Naming:** PascalCase for React components.

4. **Server vs Client:** Mark Client Components with `'use client'` directive at top of file. API routes are server-side by default (no directive needed).

5. **Import Paths:** Use `@/` alias for absolute imports:

   ```typescript
   import { HealthResponse } from '@/types/health';
   ```

6. **Error Handling:** All API routes should use try-catch and return standardized error format (for Story 1.2 health endpoint, errors unlikely but good practice).

### Environment Configuration

**[Source: docs/architecture.md#environment-configuration (lines 1727-1756)]**

**.env.example (already exists from Story 1.1):**

```bash
# Application
NODE_ENV=development

# Next.js Public (exposed to browser)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3000/api/ws
NEXT_PUBLIC_MCP_URL=http://localhost:4000

# Database (Railway injects in production)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/jive_dev

# Redis (Railway injects in production)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Authentication (Railway secrets in production)
JWT_SECRET=your-dev-jwt-secret-here
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-dev-webhook-secret-here
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

**For Story 1.2:** No new environment variables required. Health endpoint and landing page use no secrets or external services.

**Railway Environment Variables (Production):**

- Configured in Railway dashboard (not in code)
- See Architecture lines 1863-1876 for full production env var list
- Health endpoint works without any env vars (minimal dependency)

### Deployment Architecture

**[Source: docs/architecture.md#deployment-strategy (lines 1762-1787)]**

**Railway Web Service Configuration:**

- **Build Command:** `pnpm build` (already in package.json)
- **Start Command:** `pnpm start` (already in package.json)
- **Port:** 3000 (auto-detected by Railway)
- **Health Check:** `GET /api/health` (Story 1.2 implements this!)
- **Scaling:** Horizontal with sticky sessions for WebSocket (future stories)

**railway.json (already created in Story 1.1):**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "numReplicas": 1,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 3
  }
}
```

**Deployment Flow (Story 1.2 will validate this):**

1. Push to `main` branch → triggers Railway webhook
2. Railway runs `pnpm install && pnpm build`
3. Railway performs health check on new instance (calls `/api/health`)
4. Railway routes traffic to new instance
5. Old instance gracefully shuts down

**Environments:**

| Environment | Web URL                                 | Purpose                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Development | http://localhost:3000                   | Local development      |
| Staging     | https://jive-web-staging.up.railway.app | Pre-production testing |
| Production  | https://jive.railway.app                | Live environment       |

**Story 1.2 Deployment Goal:** Deploy to Staging and verify health endpoint works.

### Testing

**[Source: docs/architecture.md#testing-strategy (lines 2009-2067)]**

**Testing Approach for Story 1.2:**

Story 1.2 continues with **manual verification** approach from Story 1.1. Automated testing framework (Vitest) will be set up in Story 1.3 per PRD Epic 1.

**Manual Testing Checklist:**

1. **Health Endpoint Testing:**
   - Local dev: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/health`
   - Production build: `pnpm build && pnpm start`, then `curl http://localhost:3000/api/health`
   - Railway staging: `curl https://jive-web-staging.up.railway.app/api/health`
   - Verify JSON response format matches AC#1 exactly
   - Verify 200 status code

2. **Landing Page Testing:**
   - Load http://localhost:3000 in browser
   - Verify "JIVE Dashboard" heading visible
   - Verify health status displayed (fetched from /api/health)
   - Verify version number displayed
   - Test loading state (briefly visible on slow networks)
   - Test error handling (stop API server, reload page)

3. **Build and Type Checking:**
   - `pnpm type-check` - should pass with no errors
   - `pnpm lint` - should pass with no errors
   - `pnpm build` - should build successfully
   - `pnpm start` - production build should start and serve pages

4. **Deployment Validation (Railway):**
   - Push to GitHub repository
   - Railway auto-deploys on push to main
   - Health check passes before routing traffic
   - Public URL accessible
   - No deployment errors in Railway logs

**Future Automated Testing (Story 1.3+):**

- Unit test for health endpoint: Mock NextResponse, verify JSON structure
- Component test for landing page: Mock fetch, verify rendering
- Integration test: Start dev server, call /api/health, assert response
- Test location: `tests/unit/api/health.test.ts`, `tests/components/landing-page.test.tsx`

### UI Design Guidelines

**[Source: docs/architecture.md#tech-stack (lines 243-244)]**

**UI Framework:** shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS (already configured in Story 1.1)

**Landing Page Design (Story 1.2 - MVP):**

Since this is a **foundational health check story**, keep the landing page **minimal and functional**:

1. **Layout:** Simple centered card with Tailwind utility classes
2. **Typography:** Use Tailwind typography for heading and body text
3. **Colors:** Use shadcn/ui default slate theme (configured in Story 1.1)
4. **Spacing:** Consistent padding and margins with Tailwind spacing scale
5. **Accessibility:** Proper heading hierarchy (`<h1>` for "JIVE Dashboard")

**Example Minimal Landing Page Structure:**

```tsx
<main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center p-24">
  <div className="max-w-md w-full space-y-8">
    <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-center">JIVE Dashboard</h1>
    <div className="bg-white shadow rounded-lg p-6">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Health Status</h2>
      {/* Health status content */}
    </div>
  </div>
</main>
```

**Note:** Full dashboard UI (agent cards, artifact trees, etc.) will be implemented in later epics. Story 1.2 is **validation-focused**, not feature-rich.

### Additional Context

**Difference from PRD AC#4:** PRD originally said "Vercel deployment successful" but Architecture v1.1 (lines 92-148) specifies **Railway** as deployment platform. AC#4 updated to reflect Railway deployment.

**Railway vs Vercel Rationale (from Architecture):**

- Railway supports persistent background workers (needed for orchestrator service in future stories)
- Vercel has 10s serverless timeout (deal-breaker for long-running jobs)
- Railway provides PostgreSQL and Redis managed services
- This decision was made in Architecture v1.1 and propagates to all stories

**Health Endpoint Use Cases (Future Stories):**

- Railway health checks before routing traffic (deployment validation)
- Monitoring services (Uptime Kuma, Pingdom) can ping /api/health
- CI/CD pipelines can verify deployment success
- Internal status pages can aggregate health from all services (web, orchestrator, mcp)

**Landing Page Evolution:**

- **Story 1.2 (This Story):** Minimal dashboard with health status
- **Epic 2-5:** Full multi-project portfolio, agent cards, artifact trees, conflict detection UI
- **Phase 2:** Advanced visualizations, timeline views, plugin marketplace

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-15

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Grade: EXCELLENT**

Story 1.2 demonstrates high-quality implementation with proper TypeScript usage, clean architecture, and adherence to Next.js 15 best practices. The health endpoint and landing page are correctly implemented, and the Railway deployment is successfully validated in staging.

**Key Strengths:**

- ✓ TypeScript strict mode enforced throughout (no `any` types)
- ✓ Proper separation of Client/Server components
- ✓ Comprehensive error handling in landing page (loading, error states)
- ✓ Type-safe implementation with dedicated HealthResponse interface
- ✓ Semantic HTML and accessibility considerations
- ✓ Clean, readable code structure
- ✓ Successful staging deployment verified

**Implementation Highlights:**

- Health endpoint returns correct JSON format with ISO8601 timestamp
- Landing page dynamically fetches and displays health status
- Environment variables properly documented
- Railway configuration properly set up

### Technical Debt Assessment

**Identified Debt (Low Severity):**

1. **Missing Automated Tests** (Severity: Medium, Deferred by Design)
   - **Issue:** No automated test coverage for health endpoint or landing page
   - **Impact:** Cannot catch regressions automatically
   - **Mitigation:** Story 1.3 will introduce Vitest testing framework per PRD
   - **Status:** Accepted technical debt, planned resolution in Story 1.3

2. **No Health Endpoint Error Handling** (Severity: Low)
   - **Issue:** Health endpoint lacks try-catch block
   - **Impact:** Minimal (endpoint is simple and unlikely to fail)
   - **Recommendation:** Consider adding basic error handling for robustness
   - **Status:** Not blocking, can be addressed in future iteration

**Debt Resolved During Review:**

1. **Hardcoded Version ✓ FIXED**
   - **Was:** Version hardcoded as '0.1.2' in health endpoint
   - **Now:** Version dynamically loaded from package.json
   - **Impact:** Eliminated version drift risk

### Improvements Checklist

**QA Completed:**

- [x] Refactored health endpoint to use dynamic version from package.json
- [x] Verified TypeScript type safety (strict mode, no `any` types)
- [x] Validated production build (1.9s compile, no errors)
- [x] Confirmed staging deployment working
- [x] Verified all acceptance criteria met
- [x] Assessed NFRs (security, performance, reliability, maintainability)

**Recommendations for Dev (Optional, Non-Blocking):**

- [ ] Consider adding try-catch to health endpoint for defensive programming (low priority)
- [ ] Add aria-live region for health status updates for improved accessibility (nice-to-have)
- [ ] Consider caching health check response (1-5 seconds) to reduce server load (future optimization)

### Testability Evaluation

**Controllability: EXCELLENT**

- ✓ Health endpoint has no dependencies (fully controllable)
- ✓ Landing page can be tested with mocked fetch

**Observability: EXCELLENT**

- ✓ Clear JSON response structure from health endpoint
- ✓ UI states (loading, error, success) clearly visible
- ✓ Error messages descriptive and actionable

**Debuggability: EXCELLENT**

- ✓ TypeScript types catch errors at compile time
- ✓ Error states include meaningful messages
- ✓ Build output provides clear diagnostics

### Files Modified During Review

**Modified by QA:**

- `app/api/health/route.ts` (lines 3, 8) - Added dynamic version loading from package.json

**Note to Dev:** Please update the "File List" section in Dev Agent Record to include this QA refactoring change.

### Deployment Verification
